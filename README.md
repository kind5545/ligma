Oh no... another USELESS repo. This time: fake malware w/ tkinter!!
So, in this repo my friend and I made  
fake malware to run in python. So.
This works on all platforms; tested on a *raspberry pi*.
## Run this on your friend's computer:
We reccomend you use Windows, but macOS and Linux should work too.  
###### Step 1: install dependencies
Make sure your friend has pip installed. (it should come with python)
 - run `pip install inquirer`
 - and `pip install pillow`
Ok. download `main.py` and `amogus.gif`.
Run the file.
Done!
